                                <h3>Synopsis:</h3>
                                <p>When Subaru Natsuki leaves the convenience store, the last thing he expects is to be wrenched from his everyday life and dropped into a fantasy world. Things are not looking good for the bewildered teenager; however, not long after his arrival, he is attacked by some thugs. Armed with only a bag of groceries and a now useless cell phone, he is quickly beaten to a pulp. Fortunately, a mysterious beauty named Satella, in hot pursuit after the one who stole her insignia, happens upon Subaru and saves him. In order to thank the honest and kindhearted girl, Subaru offers to help in her search, and later that night, he even finds the whereabouts of that which she seeks. But unbeknownst to them, a much darker force stalks the pair from the shadows, and just minutes after locating the insignia, Subaru and Satella are brutally murdered.
                                <br><br>
                                However, Subaru immediately reawakens to a familiar scene—confronted by the same group of thugs, meeting Satella all over again—the enigma deepens as history inexplicably repeats itself.</p><br>
                                <h3> Review: </h3>
                                <p>Isekai is a genre where the protagonist is reincarnated/transported to another world. This genre is often hit or miss and Re:Zero hits, a bullseye one at that. It is one, if not, the best isekai I've ever seen. From Voice Acting, Animation, Story, and even Music. Everything are just the best, I often think of it as a masterpiece and only one of the few I've rated as 10/10</p>

                                <p>Tomoya Okazaki is a delinquent who finds life dull and believes he'll never amount to anything. Along with his friend Youhei Sunohara, he skips school and plans to waste his high school days away.
                                <br><br>
                                One day while walking to school, Tomoya passes a young girl muttering quietly to herself. Without warning she exclaims "Anpan!" (a popular Japanese food) which catches Tomoya's attention. He soon discovers the girl's name is Nagisa Furukawa and that she exclaims things she likes in order to motivate herself. Nagisa claims they are now friends, but Tomoya walks away passing the encounter off as nothing.
                                <br><br>
                                However, Tomoya finds he is noticing Nagisa more and more around school. Eventually he concedes and befriends her.

                                As Tomoya spends more time with the girls, he learns more about them and their problems. As he attempts to help each girl overcome her respective obstacle, he begins to realize life isn't as dull as he once thought.</p><br>
                                <h3> Review: </h3>
                                <p>Often disregarded by many because of its art style. But if one were to give it a try, they'll get hooked on the first few episodes and would bawl their eyes out from crying at the last one. It's a good mix of romance, comedy, and drama. If someone were to ask for a good tearjerker anime, this one would be it. Albeit an old series, people still remember this as one of the best dramas or rather, the best anime of all time.</p>

                                <p>Koyomi Araragi, a third-year high school student, manages to survive a vampire attack with the help of Meme Oshino, a strange man residing in an abandoned building.

                                <h3> Review: </h3>
                                <p>People would either love this or hate this. Some would say that it's boring and some would say it's a masterpiece. This series is made by NisiOisiN which is known for putting wordplay on their works. The Monogatari is indeed full of word plays and dialogue hence some people find it boring but I think that's what makes it special. It is also my favorite of all time because I find the dialogue choices intriguing. it's a series with perfect music, loveable characters, and a great story. </p>

Together with his ditzy but well-meaning friend Mayuri Shiina and his roommate Itaru Hashida, Rintarou founds the Future Gadget Laboratory in the hopes of creating technological innovations that baffle the human psyche. Despite claims of grandeur, the only notable "gadget" the trio have created is a microwave that has the mystifying power to turn bananas into green goo.
                                <br> <br>
                                However, when Rintarou decides to attend neuroscientist Kurisu Makise's conference on time travel, he experiences a series of strange events that lead him to believe that there is more to the "Phone Microwave" gadget than meets the eye.

                                <p>A sci-fi time travel series that would get you hooked just after the first few episodes. It may be fiction but most of the theories and concepts presented in these are done with research and theoretically correct. It follows our protagonist who accidentally made a time travel device and played with the concept of time and was punished for it. </p>

                                <p>According to the Republic of San Magnolia, their ongoing war against the Giadian Empire has no casualties—however, that is mere propaganda. While the silver-haired Alba of the Republic's eighty-five sectors live safely behind protective walls, those of different appearances are interned in a secret eighty-sixth faction. Known within the military as the Eighty-Six, they are forced to fight against the Empire's autonomous Legion under the command of the Republican "Handlers."
                                <br><br>
                                Vladilena Milizé is assigned to the Spearhead squadron to replace their previous Handler. Shunned by her peers for being a fellow Eighty-Six supporter, she continues to fight against their inhumane discrimination. Shinei Nouzen is the captain of the Spearhead squadron. Infamous for being the sole survivor of every squadron he's been in, he insists on shouldering the names and wishes of his fallen comrades. When the fates of these young souls from two different worlds collide, will it ignite the spark that lights their path to salvation, or will they burn themselves in the flames of despair?

                                <p>Another Sci-Fi anime but this time, it's mecha. This series isn't just about robots fighting robots. It tackles a lot of modern problem including racism, wars, politics and opressions. Our protagonists are being forced to fight a losing war while their leaders just letting them die just because they are never considered to be a human in the first place hence the "no human casualty" reports. </p>

Dumbfounded, Kyon learns of her frustration with the lack of paranormal-focused clubs at their school and unwittingly inspires her to start her own club. She creates the Spreading Fun all Over the World with Haruhi Suzumiya Brigade, otherwise known as the SOS Brigade.

                                Following the SOS Brigade's founding, Haruhi manages to recruit Kyon and three other members: quiet bookworm Yuki Nagato, shy upperclassman Mikuru Asahina, and perpetually positive Itsuki Koizumi. Despite their normal appearance, the new members of the SOS Brigade each carry their own secrets related to Haruhi. Caught up in the mystery surrounding the eccentric club leader, Kyon is whisked away on a series of misadventures by Haruhi and the SOS Brigade, each one bringing him closer to the truth about who and what she is.

                                <p>The Holy Grail War is a battle royale among seven magi who serve as Masters. Masters, through the use of the command seals they are given when they enter the war, command Heroic Spirits known as Servants to fight for them in battle. In the Fifth Holy Grail War, Rin Toosaka is among the magi entering the competition. With her Servant, Archer, she hopes to obtain the ultimate prize—the Holy Grail, a magical artifact capable of granting its wielder any wish.

                                One of Rin's classmates, Shirou Emiya, accidentally enters the competition and ends up commanding a Servant of his own known as Saber.

                                <p>Definitely, among the top when asked what are the most confusing series. While the story is simple, the titles are not. If you searched for the Fate series, you'll find tons of results and would be confused about where to start. But once you figured it out, you'll sink into what we called the nasuverse where all the series created by Nasu, a Japanese author/creator, takes place. If you become a fan, you'll find yourself asking for more and would delve into different media of fate such as manga, novels, and even games. </p>

                                <p>The world has become a slaughtering ground for the Crimson Denizens, mysterious beings from a parallel universe who thrive on the life energy of humans. These merciless murderers only leave behind scant remainders of souls called "Torches," which are mere residues that will eventually be destroyed, along with the very fact of the victims' existence from the minds of the living. In an ambitious endeavor to put an end to this invisible, hungry massacre, warriors called Flame Hazes relentlessly fight these monsters.

                                One fateful day, Yuuji Sakai ceases to be a regular high schooler—he becomes trapped in a crevice of time and is suddenly attacked by a Denizen. Coming to his rescue just in the nick of time is a nameless hunter who seems no different from an ordinary young girl except for her blazing eyes and burning crimson hair. However, before Yuuji can learn anything more about his situation, he discovers that he has already been reduced to a Torch—merely a scrap of memory waiting to be extinguished.

                                <p>Hachiman Hikigaya is an apathetic high school student with narcissistic and semi-nihilistic tendencies. He firmly believes that joyful youth is nothing but a farce, and everyone who says otherwise is just lying to themselves.

                                In a novel punishment for writing an essay mocking modern social relationships, Hachiman's teacher forces him to join the Volunteer Service Club, a club that aims to extend a helping hand to any student who seeks their support in achieving their goals. With the only other club member being the beautiful ice queen Yukino Yukinoshita, Hachiman finds himself on the front line of other people's problems—a place he never dreamed he would be.

                                <p>A series I watched years ago and I still remember how I keep on coming back to it by rewatching it at least almost every year. It's a series a lot of people relate to just because our protagonist is anti-social. While most romantic-comedy is ideal and delve into a charming fairy-tale, this series takes a realistic approach of how a teenage romance would be.</p>

                                <p>The rare and inexplicable Puberty Syndrome is thought of as a myth. It is a rare disease which only affects teenagers, and its symptoms are so supernatural that hardly anyone recognizes it as a legitimate occurrence. However, high school student Sakuta Azusagawa knows from personal experience that it is very much real, and happens to be quite prevalent in his school.
                                <br><br>
                                Mai Sakurajima is a third-year high school student who gained fame in her youth as a child actress, but recently halted her promising career for reasons unknown to the public. With an air of unapproachability, she is well known throughout the school, but none dare interact with her—that is until Sakuta sees her wandering the library in a bunny girl costume. Despite the getup, no one seems to notice her, and after confronting her, he realizes that she is another victim of Puberty Syndrome. As Sakuta tries to help Mai through her predicament, his actions bring him into contact with more girls afflicted with the elusive disease.

                                <p>What's more relatable than a series that tackles emotional trauma? This series feature the characters experiencing puberty syndrome or a sort of disease but to be honest, it's just a fancy name for a mental trauma. It's like a mix of Oregairu and the Monogatari series where the characters are relatable which made it even better.</p>

                                <p>Tomoya Aki, an otaku, has been obsessed with collecting anime and light novels for years, attaching himself to various series with captivating stories and characters. Now, he wants to have a chance of providing the same experience for others by creating his own game, but unfortunately, Tomoya cannot do this task by himself.
                                <br><br>
                                He successfully recruits childhood friend Eriri Spencer Sawamura to illustrate and literary elitist Utaha Kasumigaoka to write the script for his visual novel, while he directs. Super-group now in hand, Tomoya only needs an inspiration to base his project on, and luckily meets the beautiful, docile Megumi Katou, who he then models his main character after.

                                Using what knowledge he has, Tomoya creates a new doujin circle with hopes to touch the hearts of those who play their game. What he does not realize, is that to invoke these emotions, the creators have had to experience the same feelings in their own lives

                                <p>This Series used the most common trend in romance school anime and used it well. A lot of loveable characters but our protagonist chose the most boring one. This isn't just about romantic comedy, this also shows the hurdle to create a game from scratch. I've also gained my inspiration from this series which made me want to create my own game and pursued programming courses. </p>
